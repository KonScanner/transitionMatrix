Data per Scale
-------------------------------------------

Each rating scale is a StateSpace (see :ref:`state_space_doc`) and thus inherits the attributes and methods
of that object, namely:

* The entity defining the scale (originator)
* The full name of the scale (as most originators of rating scales offer multiple scales with different meaning an/or use)
* The definition of the scale (as a list of tuples in the form [('0', 'X1'), ... , ('N-1', 'XN)] where X are the symbols used to denote the credit state
* The CQS (credit quality score) mapping of the scale as defined by regulatory authorities (see above reference)
