State Spaces
==============================

A State Space is a fundamental concept in probability theory representing the possible configurations for a modelled system

The StateSpace object stores a state space structure as a List of tuples. The first two elements of each tuple contain the index (base-0) and label of the state space respectively.

Additional fields are reserved for further characterisation
