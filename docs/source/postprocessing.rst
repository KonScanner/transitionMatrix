Post-processing
===================

The post-processing stage includes steps and activities after the estimation of a transition matrix. The precise steps required depend on specific circumstances but might involve some of the following:


* "Fixing" a matrix by correcting deficiencies linked to data quality
* Obtaining the infinitesimal generator of a matrix, a powerful tool for further analysis
* Working with multi-period matrices
* Visualizing transition datasets and transition frequencies
