Intro
=========================
transitionMatrix is a Python powered library for the statistical analysis and visualization of state transition 
phenomena. It can be used to analyze any dataset that captures timestamped transitions in a discrete state space. 
Use cases include credit rating transitions, system state event logs etc. 

You can use transitionMatrix to

- Estimate transition matrices from historical event data using a variety of estimators
- Visualize event data and transition matrices
- Manipulate transition matrices (generators, comparisons etc.)
- Provide standardized data sets for testing
- Model transitions using threshold processes
- Map credit ratings using mapping tables between popularly used rating systems
